1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,480
So now let's look at creating an adjacency list.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:14,140
So an adjacency list is just another way of representing a graph, and we'll do this by using a hash

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,560
map.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,980
So let's look at the Vertex A it has edges with B and E.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,870
So when the hash map, we would represent this as a key value pair like this.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:38,530
The vertex itself a is the key, and then the value is going to be an array list that has all of the

7
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,040
edges.

8
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,380
So notice the double quotes are used here.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,700
That means there are strings, not chars, so you could put words in here instead of letters.

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,160
So now let's go around this graph and we'll move over to be.

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,550
It has edges with A and C C has edges with B and D.

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:09,130
D has edges with CNE, and then finally, EA has edges with Andy.

13
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:18,250
So this hash map on the right is just going to be another way of representing this graph on the left.

14
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,020
And that is our quick overview of an adjacency list.
