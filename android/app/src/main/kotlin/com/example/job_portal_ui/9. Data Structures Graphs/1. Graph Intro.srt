1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,160
OK, now let's look at graphs.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,580
We're going to start out by bringing this up.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:14,980
This is called a vertex or a node the proper way to say it is Vertex, but you'll hear the word node.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:24,270
And we'll bring up another Vertex, the plural would be vertices, then between the vertices, we have

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,440
what is called an edge or a connection, the proper way to say it is edge.

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,960
So we have vertices and edges.

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,750
Let's bring in another vertex like this.

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,070
So this vertex can have an edge with this vertex or it can have one with this one.

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,800
We're going to have one with both.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,180
There is no limit to how many other vertices that a vertex can connect to.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,620
So now that we have a small graph, let's look at a couple of concepts.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,810
Let's say you want to go from this vertex to this vertex.

13
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,730
Well, when you look at this, you would say that you don't want to go this way because that is two

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,270
hops.

15
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,050
And this one is one you'd want to go the more direct route.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,380
But with graphs, one of the things you can have, you're not always going to have, but you can have

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,390
our weighted edges.

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:34,400
So where you would use something like this would be in a Maps app, you're using Google Maps and the

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,480
road between 76 and 82 has a lot of traffic.

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,650
So you go this way instead because this has a cost of five and going this way has a cost of 15.

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,250
Another place you'll see something like this is with network routing protocols.

22
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:58,990
It would be better to have an extra router hop and have two very fast links than to go the way with

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,350
a very slow link.

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,730
And like I said, the edges can be weighted or not weighted.

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,960
So another concept with graphs which explain this with a Facebook connection between you and a friend.

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,390
So with a typical Facebook account, your friend is friends with you and you are friends with your friend.

27
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,060
It is a bi directional relationship.

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,200
So on a graph where all of the edges are bi directional, you'll often see it like this without arrows.

29
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,660
And when you see it like this, it is assumed that it goes both ways.

30
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,120
So let's compare this to something like Instagram or Twitter.

31
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,850
When you follow a celebrity.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,300
You are following the celebrity, they don't follow you back.

33
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,310
That is directional.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,910
So the edges can be weighted or non weighted.

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,780
They can be directional or bi directional.

36
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,700
Also, we have seen a graph in this course.

37
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:05,790
It was a tree.

38
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:13,950
Trees are a form of grass, but they have the limitation that each node can only point to two other

39
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,520
nodes.

40
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,300
And when we looked at trees, we had mentioned that we had seen a tree before, which was a linked list.

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,530
So link lists are a form of a tree, and a tree is a form of a graph.

42
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:36,030
Therefore, a link list is a form of a graph with the limitation that they can only point to one other

43
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,450
node.

44
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,320
But we typically think of something that looks like this when we think of graphs.
