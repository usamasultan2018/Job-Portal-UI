1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,660
So there are two ways we're going to look at being able to represent a graph.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:12,440
The first one is going to be an adjacency matrix, the other one will be an adjacency list.

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:19,100
So let's bring up a graph and we're going to represent this in an adjacency matrix.

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,230
So we'll start by looking at this a vertex.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:38,150
It has two edges with E and B, so we'll say A has edges with B and E, and we'll just put ones in those

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,020
boxes there.

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,070
And of course, A cannot have an edge with itself.

8
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,600
So we'll put a zero in that one and that it does not have an edge with C and D.

9
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,030
So we'll put zeros in there.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,370
Now, let's look at B, it has edges with A and C so B.

11
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,280
Has edges with ANC and the rest will be zeros.

12
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,440
I'll just finish building this out like this to complete our matrix.

13
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:20,500
So this axis represents the actual vertex, this axis is the items it has an edge with.

14
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,980
So now one of the things that's interesting about an adjacency matrix we had mentioned that a can't

15
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:32,920
point to a will also be can't point to B and so on.

16
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,570
You're always going to have this 45 degree line of zeros.

17
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:45,910
And if you have a bi directional matrix like we have here, you will always have a mirror image on each

18
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:49,780
side of this 45 degree line that looks like that.

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,970
But this is only if these are bi directional, so let's change one of these two directional and take

20
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:57,630
a look at that.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,330
We have a connection between A and B, so in the matrix, that is a connects to B, that's one.

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,600
B connects back to A that has a one.

23
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:17,450
But if we remove the edge that points from B to A and we changed this to a zero.

24
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,640
Now we have lost our symmetry across that 45 degree line.

25
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,810
So let's change the edge on the graph back to being bi directional and then we'll change it in the matrix.

26
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,390
And now it is symmetrical.

27
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,700
So another thing that you can have with your edges is that they can be weighted.

28
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:46,160
So if they're weighted in an adjacency matrix, we will just store these weights in the matrix like

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
this instead of having once.

30
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,320
OK, let's put that back.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,480
And that is our quick overview of an adjacency matrix.
